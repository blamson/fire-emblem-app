# Fire Emblem Dashboard

Fire Emblem is a series built on numbers. Everything, from combat outcomes to character stats, is all determined by dice rolls of varying complexity.

What's more, many of the numbers a player wants to have so they can make informed decisions are hidden from them! Thankfully, the bulk of this information has been complied by the fine folks at SerenesForest and makes up an extremely large plethora of tables over dozens of games. Check out their site, [here](https://serenesforest.net/).

This abundance of tables is a blessing and a curse however, as combining information from there requires having numerous tabs open. And, of course, we can't generate insights from that data as it is trapped online.

This project, which will extend beyond this repository, is intended to make navigating this information easier. Using **BeautifulSoup** to handle web scraping and **Pandas** for data wrangling, my goal is to pull that information and create a dashboard with a variety of features for each game. 

This dashboard will begin on Tableau and then potentially return here as a plotly dashboard.

Of course, this is an enormous undertaking and I'll be starting small. Working with just 2 games and figuring out the basic organization of data and initial quirks. But my hope is eventually I'll have something genuinelly useful that allows for convenient access to the information any fire emblem player may need both inside combat and out!
