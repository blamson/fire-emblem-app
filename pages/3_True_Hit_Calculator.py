    ## Info
    This page is for converting from the hit rates the game displays to the genuine hit rates going on under the hood.

    Intuitively you'd think a hit rate of, say, 75, means that the game rolls a 100 sided die and 
    so 75 of those rolls mean we hit and 25 of them miss. 

    However, the GBA Fire Emblem games use what's called a 2RN system. They actually roll two different dice and
    take their average. This changes the math a lot. All you need to know is that the further away from 50 the 
    displayed hit rate gets, the more extreme the real value is. High hit rates hit more than they should and
    low hit rates hit less.

    My calculator is there to save you time on figuring out what the real values are.

    The true hit resources I've found online never really dive into the math because it gets very ugly.
