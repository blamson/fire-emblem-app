    Here we've got a fight between Rutger and a boss named Henning.
    
    According to the battle forecast our boy Rutger here has a displayed hit of 70. Intuitively you'd think
    that means he has a 70% chance to hit right?

    However, the GBA Fire Emblem games use what's called a 2RN system. They actually roll two different dice and
    take their average. This changes the math a lot. Rutger really has a *true hit rate* of 82.3% because of this.
    Really, all you need to know is that the further from 50 a displayed hit gets, the more off the real chance is.
    Hit rates well above 50 hit more than they should and hit rates below 50 a whole lot less.

    My calculator is there to save you time on figuring out what the real values are.
    
    ## Why do the games do this?
    
    People are, almost by nature, extremely bad at gauging probability. This is compounded with a game like
    Fire Emblem where that thing we're bad at is directly tied into formulating strategies and assessing risk.
    Going for a $95\%$ chance to hit feels like an extremely safe move right? However, in the old FE games
    there's a $1/20$ chance you miss. That's honestly very likely over a gaming session and, for most players,
    this feels bad. Same with getting hit by a $20\%$. $1/5$ of those will land but strategically it *feels*
    like it should be a reliable play. 
    
    The 2RN system is there to make probabilities feel like they *should feel*. An $85\%$ feels like it should be pretty
    reliable and so it's been cranked up to around $95\%$. It's also in the players favor! Most of the time
    the player will be working with hit rates above $50\%$ so the player benefits from the boost. Meanwhile the enemies will
    often be below $50\%$ and taking a penalty. 
    
    Whether you like this system or not is up to preference. Personally I enjoy the punishing nature of the brutally honest
    1RN system, but there's a reason 2RN exists. It's honestly very clever!

    ## Mathematical Explanation

    The true hit resources I've found online never really dive into the math because it can get a little complicated.
    However, I think it's actually really fun to understand what's going on under the hood and I want to provide that to anyone interested!
    
    In the section below we properly dive into the topic and I hope it helps provide some insight into these games.
    This is gonna be a long one so I apologize in advance!
    
    ### Disclaimer
    
    This is a mathematical explanation but I want to keep it easy to understand for everyone. 
    There may be some jargon here or there but I will be sure to explain all of it and I expect no mathematical background coming into this.
    There's a lot of text though so be prepared to read.

        You'll also notice how the average one looks identical outside of the x axis being on a different range.
