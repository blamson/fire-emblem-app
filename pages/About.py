    # About Me and Contact Info
    
    This project is a solo development project by me, Brady Lamson.
    I'm a Data Scientist who grew up playing FE8 because I thought Ephraim was Marth!
    
    If you want to contact me or follow my development more closely I have a few ways to do so.
    
    - [Application Repository](https://github.com/blamson/fire_emblem_app)
    - [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brady-lamson/)
    - [My Personal Website](https://bradylamson.com/)
    - My email: lamsonbrady@gmail.com
    
    I post fairly regularly to linkedin and my personal website as I make progress on anything I'm working on.
    If you want to collaborate and help me with this project let me know! I'd be more than happy to do so.
